# Welcome

Buck is a **yield-bearing savings coin** backed by STRC — Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock — delivering **\~10% APY** through contractual dividends rather than token emissions or trading strategies.

## How BUCK Works

BUCK holders earn \~10% annualized yield from STRC dividends, distributed monthly. Your BUCK stays in your wallet, and yield is distributed automatically in BUCK on the first business day of each month.

| Day | BUCK Price | Your 1,000 BUCK Value |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 0   | $1.00      | $1,000                |
| 90  | $1.025     | $1,025                |
| 180 | $1.05      | $1,050                |
| 365 | $1.10      | $1,100                |

**Hold BUCK. Receive yield monthly. It's that simple.**

## BUCK Token

| Token    | Purpose      | Value Driver                                          |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **BUCK** | Savings coin | \~10% APY from STRC's contractual preferred dividends |

## Why Buck?

{% hint style="info" %}
**External Yield, Not Emissions**

Buck's yield comes from real dividends paid by STRC — Strategy's 10% preferred stock backed by $60B+ in Bitcoin. It's real yield from real assets.
