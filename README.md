# Welcome

Buck is a **yield-bearing savings coin** backed by STRC — Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock — delivering **\~10% APY** through contractual dividends rather than token emissions or trading strategies.



BUCK is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT.&#x20;

This means that the risks implicated by interacting with BUCK are inherently different.

BUCK is not an offer of securities or financial advice. Buck is not available for US persons. [Terms](http://buck.io/terms) Apply. Please refer to our extensive[ ](https://docs.ethena.fi/solution-overview/risks)Safety & Risks section for additional information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You could lose some or all of your funds. Holding BUCK is not risk-free. Yield is not guaranteed and depends on the continued payment of STRC dividends. BUCK is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. Past performance and projected returns are not indicative of future results.
{% endhint %}

## How BUCK Works

BUCK holders earn \~10% annualized yield from STRC dividends, distributed monthly. Your BUCK stays in your wallet, and yield is distributed automatically in BUCK on the fourth business day of each month.

| Day | BUCK Price | Your 1,000 BUCK Value |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 0   | $1.00      | $1,000                |
| 90  | $1.025     | $1,025                |
| 180 | $1.05      | $1,050                |
| 365 | $1.10      | $1,100                |

**Hold BUCK. Receive 10% yield monthly. It's that simple.**

## Why Buck?

{% hint style="info" %}
**External Yield, Not Emissions**

Buck's yield comes from real dividends paid by STRC — Strategy's preferred stock backed by $60B+ in Bitcoin. It's real yield from real assets.
{% endhint %}

* **\~10% APY** — From STRC's contractual quarterly dividends
* **Over-collateralized** — More than $1 backing per $1 of BUCK
* **Monthly distributions** — Yield distributed automatically on the 4th business day of each month
