description: Hard Money — A value-accruing savings coin
---

# Welcome

Buck is a **value-accruing savings coin** backed by a diversified treasury of hard assets — Bitcoin, gold, U.S. treasuries, and institutional yield instruments — delivering **\~10% annualized value growth** through external dividends rather than token emissions or trading strategies.

## How BUCK Works

Unlike traditional stablecoins that maintain a fixed $1.00 price, BUCK's price **steadily increases over time** as yield from hard asset backing accrues directly to the token's value.

| Day | BUCK Price | Your 1,000 BUCK Value |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 0   | $1.00      | $1,000                |
| 90  | $1.025     | $1,025                |
| 180 | $1.05      | $1,050                |
| 365 | $1.10      | $1,100                |

**No claiming. No staking. Just hold BUCK and watch it grow.**

## Why Buck?

{% hint style="info" %}
**External Yield, Not Emissions**

Buck's yield comes from real dividends paid by institutional hard assets — not funding rate arbitrage or token inflation. It's real yield from real assets, backed by the hardest money in the world.
