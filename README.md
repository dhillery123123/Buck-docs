# Welcome to Buck

Buck is a **value-accruing savings coin** backed by STRC (Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock), delivering **10% annualized value growth** through external dividends rather than token emissions or trading strategies.

## How BUCK Works

Unlike traditional stablecoins that maintain a fixed $1.00 price, BUCK's price **steadily increases over time** as yield from STRC dividends accrues directly to the token's value.

| Day | BUCK Price | Your 1,000 BUCK Value |
|-----|------------|----------------------|
| 0 | $1.00 | $1,000 |
| 90 | $1.025 | $1,025 |
| 180 | $1.05 | $1,050 |
| 365 | $1.10 | $1,100 |

**No claiming. No staking. Just hold BUCK and watch it grow.**

## BUCK Token

| Token | Purpose | Value Driver |

## Why Buck?

{% hint style="info" %}
**External Yield, Not Emissions**

Buck's yield comes from real dividends paid by STRC—Strategy's preferred equity backed by their $60B+ Bitcoin treasury. This isn't funding rate arbitrage or token inflation. It's real yield from a real asset.
{% endhint %}
