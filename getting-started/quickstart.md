# Quick Start Guide

## Choose Your Path

| Path              | Difficulty | Rewards                     | Best For           |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |

## Path 1: Hold BUCK (Easiest)

### Step 1: Get USDC

You need USDC on Ethereum mainnet. Bridge from other chains or buy on an exchange.

### Step 2: Connect to buck.io

1. Go to [buck.io](https://buck.io)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)

### Step 3: Mint BUCK

1. Enter the USDC amount you want to convert
2. Review the exchange rate (shows how much BUCK you'll receive)
3. Click "Mint"
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Step 4: Receive Yield Monthly

Yield is distributed automatically in BUCK each month. See [Monthly Distribution](../yield/distribution.md) for eligibility details.

**Three reward streams.** Hold BUCK and earn STRC yield (distributed automatically), Points (automatic), and Merkl BUCK rewards (claim weekly at merkl.xyz). See [Buck Points Program](../rewards/points-program.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

## Path 2: Provide LP (Higher Rewards)

### Why Provide Liquidity?

| Benefit             | Details                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **3x Points**       | LP positions earn 3x vs holding |
| **Trading Fees**    | \~1-2% APY from swaps           |
| **Merkl Rewards**   | $4,167/week (Curve)             |
| **Protocol Impact** | Deep liquidity helps Buck grow  |

### Step 1: Get BUCK + USDC

You need roughly equal value of both tokens.

**Example:** $5,000 BUCK + $5,000 USDC = $10,000 LP position

### Step 2: Add Liquidity on Curve

Curve is optimized for stablecoin swaps with lower slippage.

1. Go to [curve.fi](https://curve.fi)
2. Find the BUCK/USDC pool
3. Click "Deposit"
4. Enter your BUCK and USDC amounts
5. Approve tokens and confirm deposit

LP positions earn 3x Points multiplier, trading fees, and Merkl BUCK rewards. See [Buck Points Program](../rewards/points-program.md) for multiplier details.

## Path 3: Refer Friends

### How It Works

1. Get your unique referral link from [buck.io](https://buck.io) (powered by Merkl)
2. Share with friends
3. When they mint $100+ BUCK, you earn **10% of their Points** — forever

### Requirements

| Requirement      | Details                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Minimum mint** | Referee must mint $100+ BUCK        |
| **Where**        | Must mint through buck.io (not DEX) |
| **Duration**     | You earn as long as they earn       |

### Example

Your friend mints $10,000 BUCK and holds for 30+ days:

* They earn 5,000 Points/day (5x multiplier at 30+ days)
* You earn 500 Points/day (10% of theirs)
* Over 8 weeks: They get 280,000 Points, you get 28,000 Points
