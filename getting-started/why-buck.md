description: Hard Money — Real yield from real assets

# Why Buck?

## Hard Money

Buck is a savings coin that pays you \~10% annually just for holding it. No staking. No claiming. No complexity. Your BUCK automatically increases in value every day.

## What Makes Buck Different

### Real Yield from Real Assets

Buck's yield comes from a diversified treasury of hard assets — Bitcoin, gold, U.S. treasuries, and institutional yield instruments that pay contractual dividends. This isn't token inflation or trading strategies. It's real yield from the hardest money in the world.

### Your BUCK Grows Automatically

| Day | BUCK Price | 1,000 BUCK Value |
| --- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0   | $1.00      | $1,000           |
| 90  | $1.025     | $1,025           |
| 180 | $1.05      | $1,050           |
| 365 | $1.10      | $1,100           |

No gas costs. No reward claiming. Just hold.

### Yield That Can't Go Negative

Buck's yield comes from contractually obligated dividend payments. Unlike funding rates or trading strategies, these dividends don't reverse. Your BUCK will never be worth less tomorrow than it is today (absent a redemption).

### Bitcoin Exposure Without the Volatility

Buck's treasury holds Bitcoin directly — giving you exposure to the hardest money ever created, wrapped in a yield-generating savings coin without holding volatile BTC directly.

## The Hard Money Advantage

### What Backs Buck?

A diversified treasury of the world's hardest assets:

| Asset                            | Role                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Institutional Yield Instruments** | Primary yield engine (\~10% annual dividends) |
| **Bitcoin**                      | Hard money reserve             |
| **Gold**                         | Traditional safe haven         |
| **U.S. Treasuries**             | Risk-free baseline             |

### Why This Matters for You

| **Yield**           | 0%   | \~5-15%        | \~4.65%     | **\~10%**         |
| **Can go negative** | N/A  | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No        | **❌ No**          |
| **Yield source**    | None | Funding rates  | T-Bills     | **Hard asset dividends** |

Buck combines the best of each: high yield like Ethena, can't go negative like Ondo, fully DeFi-native like USDC, plus hard money backing.
