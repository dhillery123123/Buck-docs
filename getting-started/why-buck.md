# Why Buck?

## Real Yield from Real Assets

Buck is a savings coin that pays \~10% APY through STRC — Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock. STRC pays contractual quarterly dividends, and Buck passes this yield to holders via monthly distributions.

## What Makes Buck Different

### Yield from STRC Dividends

Buck's yield comes from **STRC**, Strategy's perpetual preferred stock on NASDAQ. STRC dividends are contractually obligated — not trading profits, not token inflation, not funding rates. This is real yield from a publicly traded instrument backed by the world's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

For full STRC details, see [Yield Overview](../yield/overview.md#what-is-strc).

### Monthly Distributions

Yield is distributed automatically in BUCK each month. [Learn about monthly distributions →](../yield/distribution.md)
