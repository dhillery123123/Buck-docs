description: The Bitcoin Dollar — Real yield from real assets

# Why Buck?

## The Bitcoin Dollar

Buck is a savings coin that pays you \~10% annually just for holding it. No staking. No claiming. No complexity. Your BUCK automatically increases in value every day.

## What Makes Buck Different

### Real Yield from Real Assets

Buck's yield comes from STRC — Strategy's preferred equity that pays 10% annual ROC dividends. This isn't token inflation or trading strategies. It's contractual dividend payments from a NASDAQ-listed security backed by $60B+ in Bitcoin.

### Your BUCK Grows Automatically

| Day | BUCK Price | 1,000 BUCK Value |
| --- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0   | $1.00      | $1,000           |
| 90  | $1.025     | $1,025           |
| 180 | $1.05      | $1,050           |
| 365 | $1.10      | $1,100           |

No gas costs. No reward claiming. Just hold.

### Yield That Can't Go Negative

STRC dividends are contractually obligated payments. Unlike funding rates or trading strategies, ROC dividends don't reverse. Your BUCK will never be worth less tomorrow than it is today (absent a redemption).

### Bitcoin Exposure Without the Volatility

STRC is backed by Strategy's Bitcoin treasury — the largest corporate BTC holder in the world. You get indirect Bitcoin exposure through a yield-generating wrapper, without holding volatile BTC directly.

## The STRC Advantage

### What is STRC?

Strategy's (formerly MicroStrategy) 10% preferred stock:

| Property                  | Value                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Annual Dividend**       | 10% (paid quarterly)              |
| **Backing**               | Strategy's $60B+ Bitcoin treasury |
| **Overcollateralization** | 5x by BTC holdings                |
| **Cash Reserves**         | $2.25B (77.4 years of dividends)  |
| **Trading Venue**         | NASDAQ (US-regulated)             |

### Why This Matters for You

```
You hold BUCK
      ↓
Buck Protocol holds STRC
      ↓
Strategy pays 10% dividends on STRC
      ↓
Dividends increase Buck treasury value
      ↓
BUCK exchange rate rises
      ↓
Your BUCK is worth more
```

Strategy would need to formally default on preferred equity obligations for dividends to stop. With 77+ years of cash coverage, this is extremely unlikely.

## How Buck Compares

|                     | USDC | sUSDe (Ethena) | USDY (Ondo) | **BUCK**          |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| **Yield**           | 0%   | \~5-15%        | \~4.65%     | **\~10%**         |
| **Can go negative** | N/A  | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No        | **❌ No**          |
| **Yield source**    | None | Funding rates  | T-Bills     | ROC **Dividends** |

Buck combines the best of each: high yield like Ethena, can't go negative like Ondo, fully DeFi-native like USDC, plus Bitcoin exposure.
