# Why Buck?

## Real Yield from Real Assets

Buck is a savings coin that pays \~10% APY through STRC — Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock. STRC pays contractual quarterly dividends, and Buck passes this yield to holders via monthly distributions.

## What Makes Buck Different

### Yield from STRC Dividends

Buck's yield comes from **STRC**, Strategy's 10% perpetual preferred stock on NASDAQ. STRC dividends are contractually obligated — not trading profits, not token inflation, not funding rates. This is real yield from a publicly traded instrument backed by the world's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

| Property                   | Details                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Yield Source**           | STRC (Strategy's 10% preferred stock)      |
| **Dividend Rate**          | 10% annual, paid quarterly                 |
| **Cash Reserves**          | $2.25B (77.4 years of coverage)            |
| **Bitcoin Backing**        | Strategy holds $60B+ in BTC                |
| **Over-collateralization** | 100%+ protocol-level, 5x at Strategy level |

### Yield That Can't Go Negative

STRC dividends are contractually obligated preferred equity payments. Unlike funding rates or trading strategies, these dividends don't reverse. Your yield will never be negative.

### Bitcoin Exposure Without the Volatility

Buck's treasury holds STRC — backed by Strategy's $60B+ Bitcoin reserve. You get indirect exposure to the world's hardest digital asset, wrapped in a yield-generating savings coin.

### Monthly Distributions

On the **15th of each month**, STRC dividend yield is distributed automatically to BUCK holders during the eligibility window (9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET). Just hold BUCK — yield arrives in your wallet as USDC.
