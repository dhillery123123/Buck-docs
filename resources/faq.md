# FAQ

## General

### What is BUCK?

BUCK is a **yield-bearing savings coin** backed by STRC (Strategy's Bitcoin-collateralized preferred stock). BUCK holders earn \~10% APY from STRC's contractual quarterly dividends, distributed monthly.

### How does BUCK generate yield?

Through STRC's monthly dividends, paid to Buck's treasury, distributed monthly to BUCK holders. See [Yield Overview](../yield/overview.md) for full details.

### Do I need to claim my yield?

**No.** Yield is distributed automatically as additional BUCK tokens. Hold BUCK during the eligibility window on the 15th, and yield is distributed on the first business day of the following month. See [Monthly Distribution](../yield/distribution.md) for details.

## Yield & Distribution

### When do I receive yield?

On the **1st of each month** following the most recent eligibility window. If the 1st falls on a weekend or market holiday, distribution moves to the next trading day.

### Why is the eligibility window the 15th from 9 AM - 4 PM ET?

STRC trades on NASDAQ during U.S. market hours. The eligibility window aligns with these hours so that STRC pricing is live and accurate during distribution.

### What if I don't hold during the eligibility window?

Your portion rolls into the next month's distribution pool.

### What currency is yield paid in?

BUCK. Your BUCK balance increases with additional Buck tokens.

2. Connect your wallet
3. Deposit USDC

### Can I always redeem BUCK?

## Safety & Risk

### Is BUCK audited?

Yes. Multiple audits completed by Cyfrin, Halborn, and Spearbit.

### What backs BUCK?

* **STRC** — Strategy's preferred stock ($60B+ BTC backing, $2.25B cash reserves)
* **USDC Liquidity Reserve** — For redemptions
* **100%+ Overcollateralization** — $1.00+ of backing per $1 of BUCK

### What if STRC dividends stop?

STRC dividends are contractually obligated preferred equity payments. If they were reduced or suspended:
