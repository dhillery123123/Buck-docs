# Governance Token

## Overview

Buck Protocol's governance token enables community ownership and aligns long-term holders with protocol success through **direct revenue sharing** and governance rights.

{% hint style="success" %}
**25% of Protocol Revenue**

Every fee collected by Buck Protocol—from minting, redemption, and transaction fees—25% is used to buy back governance tokens and distribute to holders. No staking required.
{% endhint %}

## Token Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) |
| **Standard** | ERC-20 |
| **Chain** | Ethereum |
| **TGE** | Following Season 1 completion |

## Token Allocation

| Category | Allocation | Tokens | Vesting |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Community Rewards** | 25-30% | 250-300M | Via seasonal points programs |
| **Ecosystem Growth** | 20% | 200M | 24-month linear |
| **Team & Contributors** | 15% | 150M | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear |

| **Foundation** | 15% | 150M | Operations & development |
| **Investors** | 5% | 50M | 1-year cliff, 2-year linear |

### Community Allocation Breakdown

The 25-30% community allocation is distributed across seasons:

| Season | Allocation | Timing |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Season 1** | 5% (50M tokens) | 16 weeks, pre-TGE |
| **Season 2** | 5% (50M tokens) | Post-TGE |
| **Season 3** | 5% (50M tokens) | Post-Season 2 |
| **Future Seasons** | 10-15% | Governance-determined |

### Allocation Comparison

| Protocol | Community | Team/Investors | Foundation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Buck** | **25-30%** | 20% | 15% |
| Ethena (ENA) | 28% | 55% | 15% |
| Falcon (FF) | 8.3% + 35% ecosystem | 24.5% | 32.2% |
| Maple (SYRUP) | ~24% | 41.5% | 30% |

Buck prioritizes community ownership with the highest direct community allocation among comparable protocols.

### How Buybacks Work

1. **Collection** — Fees accumulate in protocol treasury
2. **Execution** — Weekly automatic buybacks via DEX
3. **Distribution** — Purchased tokens distributed pro-rata to all holders
4. **Transparency** — All transactions on-chain and verifiable

{% hint style="info" %}
**No Staking Required**

Unlike protocols that require staking to earn rewards, Buck distributes buybacks to ALL token holders automatically. Just hold tokens in your wallet.
{% endhint %}

### Revenue Share Comparison

| Protocol | Token | Revenue to Holders | Staking Required? |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Buck** | Governance | **25% buybacks** | ❌ No |
| Maple | SYRUP | 25% buybacks | ❌ No (removed Nov 2025) |
| Ethena | ENA | TBD | ✅ Yes |
| Ondo | ONDO | 0% | N/A |

Buck and Maple both moved to a simpler model: hold tokens, receive value. No extra steps.

## Token Holder Benefits

### What You Get

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Buyback Distribution** | Pro-rata share of weekly buybacks |
| **Governance Rights** | Vote on protocol parameters |
| **Points Multiplier** | 2x during future reward campaigns |

### How It Works

```
Hold Governance Token
        │
        ├── Automatically receive buyback distributions
        ├── Vote on proposals (1 token = 1 vote)
        └── Boosted points in future seasons
```

No staking, no lockups, no cooldown periods. Just hold.

## Governance

### Voting Power

All token holders can vote. 1 token = 1 vote.

### Governance Scope

Token holders can vote on:

* **Protocol Parameters** — Collateralization ratios, fee structures
* **Revenue Allocation** — Adjustments to the 25/50/25 split
* **Collateral Policy** — Approved collateral types and limits
* **Integration Approvals** — New DeFi protocol partnerships
* **Treasury Deployment** — STRC acquisition strategy
* **Upgrade Proposals** — Smart contract upgrades
* **Future Season Allocations** — Community reward distributions

### Governance Process

```
1. Forum Discussion (3 days minimum)
         │
         ▼
2. Temperature Check (Snapshot, 2 days)
         │
         ▼
3. Formal Vote (On-chain, 5 days)
         │
         ▼
4. Execution (Timelock: 48 hours)
```

### Quorum Requirements

| Proposal Type | Quorum |
|---------------|--------|
| Standard | 4% of supply |
| Critical (parameters, upgrades) | 10% of supply |

## Season Loyalty Program

Early participants receive ongoing benefits:

| Participation | Season 2 Boost | Season 3 Boost |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Season 1 only | +10% points | +10% points |
| Season 1 + 2 | — | +15% points |
| All seasons | Compounding | Compounding |

This rewards long-term alignment over mercenary farming.

## Revenue Projections

### Projected Buyback Value

| TVL | Annual Fees | 25% to Buybacks |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| $10M | $60K | $15K |
| $50M | $300K | $75K |
| $100M | $600K | $150K |
| $500M | $3M | $750K |
| $1B | $6M | $1.5M |

*Assumes 10bps average fee on 50% monthly turnover*

### Threshold-Based Escalation

As protocol matures, governance can increase revenue share:

| TVL Milestone | Buyback % | Treasury % | Insurance % |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| $0 - $50M | 25% | 50% | 25% |
| $50M - $250M | 30% | 50% | 20% |
| $250M - $1B | 35% | 50% | 15% |
| $1B+ | 40% | 50% | 10% |

## How to Acquire Governance Tokens

1. **Points Program** — Participate in [Season 1](points-program.md) to earn allocation
2. **DEX** — Purchase on Curve or Uniswap (post-TGE)
3. **Buyback Distributions** — Hold tokens to receive your share

## Timeline
