# Governance (Coming Soon)

Buck Protocol will launch a governance token that gives holders direct participation in protocol success through **revenue-funded buybacks and burns**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Points → Governance Tokens**

Your accumulated points from the [Points Program](points-program.md) will convert to governance tokens at TGE. Start earning now to maximize your allocation.

## Revenue Commitment

We're committing now to the tokenomics of our future governance token:

```

### 25% → Buyback & Burn

From day one, **25% of all protocol revenue** will be used to:

1. **Buy** governance tokens from the open market
2. **Burn** them permanently, reducing total supply

This creates continuous buy pressure and deflation — the more the protocol earns, the more tokens get burned.

## What Token Holders Will Get

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Revenue Share** | 25% of protocol fees fund token buybacks and burns |
| **Governance Rights** | Vote on protocol parameters, fee structures, treasury deployment |
| **Staking Benefits** | Boosted rewards and fee discounts for stakers |

## Governance Scope

Token holders will be able to vote on:

* **Protocol Parameters** — Collateralization ratios, fee structures
* **Revenue Allocation** — Adjustments to the 25/50/25 split
* **Collateral Policy** — Approved collateral types and limits
* **Integration Approvals** — New DeFi protocol partnerships
* **Treasury Deployment** — STRC acquisition strategy
* **Upgrade Proposals** — Smart contract upgrades

## Competitive Comparison

| Protocol | Revenue to Token Holders | Mechanism |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Buck** | **25%** | Buyback & burn |
| Maple (SYRUP) | 25% | Buybacks + staking |
| Ethena (ENA) | TBD | Fee switch pending |
| Ondo (ONDO) | 0% | None |

## Revenue Projections

### Projected Annual Buyback & Burn Value

| TVL | Annual Revenue | 25% to Buyback & Burn |
|-----|----------------|----------------------|
| $10M | $200K | $50K |
| $50M | $1M | $250K |
| $100M | $2M | $500K |
| $500M | $10M | $2.5M |
| $1B | $20M | $5M |

*Revenue = 1% yield spread + 1% annual transaction fees*

## Timeline

| Phase | Status |
