# Points Program

Buck Protocol rewards early adopters through a points program that tracks your participation and positions you for future rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Points?**

Points let us reward genuine protocol usage over time, rather than one-time actions. Your points accumulate based on how much BUCK you hold, how long you hold it, and how actively you participate in the ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## How to Earn Points

| Activity | Points Rate | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Hold BUCK** | 1 point per $1 per day | Core earning mechanism |
| **Provide LP** | 3 points per $1 per day | Curve, Uniswap BUCK pools |
| **Mint BUCK** | 10 points per $1 minted | One-time bonus |
| **Refer Users** | 10% of referee's points | Ongoing referral bonus |

## Multipliers

Boost your point earning rate:

| Action | Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Early Adopter** | 3x | First 30 days of each season |
| **Diamond Hands** | 1.5x | No redemptions in rolling 30 days |
| **LP Provider** | 2x | While actively providing liquidity |
| **Lock Bonus (30 days)** | 2x | Commit to holding |
| **Lock Bonus (90 days)** | 3x | Stronger commitment |
| **Lock Bonus (180 days)** | 5x | Maximum commitment |

### Example Calculation

```
Daily Points = (BUCK Value) × (Base Rate) × (Multipliers)

Example:
- Hold 10,000 BUCK (~$10,500 value)
- Providing LP (3x base rate)
- Early Adopter active (3x)
- 90-day lock (3x)

Daily Points = 10,500 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 283,500 points/day
```

## Season Structure

The points program runs in seasons, each with its own points pool:

| Season | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Season 1** | Early adopters & BUCK holders | 🔜 Coming Soon |
| **Season 2** | LP providers & DeFi integrations | Planned |
| **Season 3** | Growth & ecosystem expansion | Planned |

## What Points Get You

Your accumulated points will convert to **governance tokens** at TGE (Token Generation Event). More points = more tokens.

See [Governance (Coming Soon)](governance.md) for details on what the governance token will unlock.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

We've designed the program to reward genuine participation:

| Risk | Protection |
|------|------------|
| Wash trading | Time-weighted daily snapshots |
| Sybil attacks | Minimum holding periods |
| Flash loans | Random snapshot timing |
| Mercenary capital | Diamond Hands multiplier |
| Whale dominance | Diminishing returns above $1M |

### Diminishing Returns

To ensure fair distribution:

| BUCK Holdings | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| $0 - $100K | 1.0x |
| $100K - $500K | 0.9x (on excess) |
| $500K - $1M | 0.8x (on excess) |
| $1M+ | 0.7x (on excess) |

## Timeline

## FAQ

### When does Season 1 start?

Season 1 launch date will be announced on our [Twitter](https://x.com/BuckToken) and [Telegram](https://t.me/buck_discussions).

### Are my points safe?

Points are tracked off-chain but verifiable. All on-chain activity (holdings, LP positions) is recorded and used to calculate points.

### Can I lose points?

No, points don't decrease. However, you can miss out on multipliers by redeeming BUCK or withdrawing LP.
