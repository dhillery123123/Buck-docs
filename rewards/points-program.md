## How to Earn Buck Points

### Activity Weights

| Activity           | Weight | Description              |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------ |
| Holding            | 50%    | Hold BUCK in your wallet |
| LP (Curve/Uniswap) | 30%    | Provide BUCK liquidity   |
| Morpho Lending     | 10%    | Lend on Morpho markets   |
| Referrals          | 10%    | Refer new users          |

### Multipliers

Multipliers boost your Buck Point earning rate. They **do not stack** — the highest applicable multiplier is used.

#### Hold Duration Multiplier

| Duration  | Multiplier |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 0-29 days | 1x         |
| 30+ days  | 3x         |

#### Activity Multipliers

| Activity       | Multiplier |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Hold BUCK      | 1x         |
| Curve LP       | 3x         |
| Uniswap V3 LP  | 3x         |
| Morpho Lending | 3x         |

> Multipliers don't stack. If you're an LP with 30+ days of holding, you get max(3x, 3x) = 3x, not 9x.

## Earning Examples

### Example 1: Hold $10,000 BUCK for 8 weeks

| Period     | Rate | Daily Buck Points | Total       |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Days 1-29  | 1x   | 1,000             | 29,000      |
| Days 30-56 | 3x   | 3,000             | 81,000      |
| **Total**  |      |                   | **110,000** |

### Example 2: $10,000 in Curve LP for 8 weeks

| Period    | Rate | Daily Buck Points | Total       |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Days 1-56 | 3x   | 3,000             | 168,000     |
| **Total** |      |                   | **168,000** |

> LP multiplier (3x) applies from day 1. After 30+ days, the hold duration multiplier matches at 3x — no additional benefit.

## Concurrent BUCK Rewards

In addition to Buck Points, Merkl distributes BUCK tokens directly during Season 1 in **2-week batches**:

| Pool          | Per Batch   | 8-Week Total |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Holders       | $12,500     | $50,000      |
| Curve LP      | $8,333      | $33,333      |
| Uniswap V3 LP | $4,167      | $16,667      |
| **Total**     | **$25,000** | **$100,000** |

These BUCK rewards are earned alongside Buck Points — they're separate reward streams.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

* **Daily snapshots** — Balances are captured daily, not at a single point in time
* **Minimum threshold** — $100 BUCK equivalent required to earn Buck Points
* **Continuous holding** — Moving tokens resets your hold duration multiplier

## Disclaimer

Points are non-monetary participation indicators used within the Buck ecosystem. They are designed to recognize and reflect a user’s level of activity, engagement, and contribution (for example, forum participation, holding Buck Tokens, or involvement in community initiatives). Points are non-transferable, have no monetary value, and do not confer any legal, ownership, governance, or financial rights in or over any Buck-related entity.

Any references to potential future features are illustrative only and do not constitute a roadmap, promise, or commitment. Users should not acquire Buck Tokens or seek to accumulate points in anticipation of, or reliance upon, any future distributions, upgrades, or additional rights.
