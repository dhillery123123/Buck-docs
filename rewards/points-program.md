# Points Program

## Season 1 Overview

Buck's Points Program rewards early participants with governance token allocation. Season 1 runs for **16 weeks** with **5% of governance tokens** allocated to point earners.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Dual Rewards: Points + BUCK**

During the Genesis Period (Weeks 1-8), earn both points AND direct BUCK rewards through our Merkl campaign. This is the highest-reward period in Buck's history.
{% endhint %}

## Season 1 Structure

Season 1 is divided into two periods with different multipliers:

| Period | Weeks | Points Multiplier | Merkl BUCK Rewards |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Genesis** | 1-8 | **3x** | ✅ Active ($12,500/week) |
| **Growth** | 9-16 | **1.5x** | ❌ Ended |

### Why Two Periods?

**Genesis Period (Weeks 1-8):** Maximum rewards create urgency. Merkl BUCK distributions provide immediate value while points accumulate for TGE. This bootstraps TVL and DEX liquidity.

**Growth Period (Weeks 9-16):** Merkl ends, filtering out mercenary capital. Remaining participants are aligned with long-term governance—exactly who should receive tokens.

## How to Earn Points

### Base Earning Rates

| Action | Base Rate | Genesis (3x) | Growth (1.5x) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Hold BUCK** | 1 pt / $1 / day | 3 pts | 1.5 pts |
| **Curve LP** | 3 pts / $1 / day | 9 pts | 4.5 pts |
| **Uniswap LP** | 2 pts / $1 / day | 6 pts | 3 pts |
| **Mint BUCK** | 5 pts / $1 (one-time) | 15 pts | 7.5 pts |

### Why LP Earns More

Liquidity providers take on additional risk (impermanent loss) and provide critical infrastructure for the protocol. Deep DEX liquidity enables:

- Morpho curator confidence in liquidations
- Better price execution for all users
- Protocol credibility with integrations

Curve receives higher weighting (3x vs 2x) as the primary stablecoin venue.

### Mint Bonus

The 5x mint bonus is a **one-time credit** per wallet. It rewards users who mint directly through buck.io rather than buying on DEXs—minting grows protocol TVL while DEX purchases don't.

## Multipliers

### Time-Based Multipliers

| Multiplier | Bonus | Condition |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Genesis** | 3x | Participate during Weeks 1-8 |
| **Growth** | 1.5x | Participate during Weeks 9-16 |
| **Diamond Hands** | 1.25x | Hold continuously for 30+ days |

### Position-Based Adjustments

| Adjustment | Effect | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Whale Cap** | 0.5x above $500K | Ensures broad distribution |
| **Minimum Balance** | $100 to earn | Sybil resistance |

### Multiplier Stacking

Multipliers stack multiplicatively:

```
Example (Genesis + Curve LP + Diamond Hands):
Base: 1 pt/$1/day
× Curve LP: 3x = 3 pts
× Genesis: 3x = 9 pts  
× Diamond Hands: 1.25x = 11.25 pts/$1/day
```

## Merkl BUCK Rewards (Weeks 1-8)

Alongside points, the Genesis Period includes direct BUCK distributions via Merkl:

| Pool | Weekly BUCK | 8-Week Total | Expected APY* |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **BUCK Holders** | $6,250 | $50,000 | ~75% |
| **Curve LP** | $4,167 | $33,333 | ~50% |
| **Uniswap LP** | $2,083 | $16,667 | ~50% |
| **Total** | $12,500 | $100,000 | — |

*APY estimates at $500K TVL. Actual rates depend on total participation.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Two Reward Streams**

During Genesis, you earn BOTH:
1. **Points** → Convert to governance tokens at TGE
2. **BUCK** → Immediate value, auto-deposited weekly
{% endhint %}

## Converting Points to Governance Tokens

### Pro-Rata Distribution

Your governance token allocation is calculated as:

```
Your Allocation = (Your Points ÷ Total Points Earned) × Season 1 Pool

Where:
- Season 1 Pool = 5% of total governance token supply
- Total governance supply = 1,000,000,000 tokens
- Season 1 Pool = 50,000,000 tokens
```

### Example Calculation

```
You earned: 10,000,000 points
Total earned by all users: 1,000,000,000 points
Season 1 pool: 50,000,000 tokens

Your allocation: (10M ÷ 1B) × 50M = 500,000 governance tokens
```

### Why Pro-Rata?

Pro-rata distribution ensures:
- Predictable total dilution (exactly 5% for S1)
- Rewards relative contribution fairly
- No gaming through last-minute deposits

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Time-Weighted Snapshots

Points are calculated using random hourly snapshots, not end-of-period balances. This prevents:
- Last-minute deposits before snapshots
- Flash loan manipulation
- Cross-protocol arbitrage

### Continuous Holding Requirement

The Diamond Hands multiplier requires **continuous** holding. Any break in holding (selling, transferring) resets the 30-day counter.

### Whale Cap

Positions above $500K earn at 0.5x rate. This ensures:
- Broader distribution across community
- No single wallet dominates allocation
- Still rewards large holders, just at diminishing rate

### Sybil Resistance

- Minimum $100 balance to earn points
- Only official pools count for LP rewards
- Referral abuse detection

| **Hold BUCK** | Low | Base points + BUCK appreciation | Passive participants |
| **Curve LP** | Medium | 3x points + trading fees | Active DeFi users |
| **Uniswap LP** | Medium | 2x points + trading fees | Active DeFi users |

### Step 3: Track Progress

## Competitive Context

Buck's points design draws from proven models:

| Protocol | S1 Allocation | S1 Duration | Model |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Ethena** | 5% | 6 weeks | Shards → ENA |
| **Falcon** | 8.3% | Ongoing | Miles → FF |
| **Maple** | ~24% | Quarterly | Drips → SYRUP |
| **Buck** | 5% | 16 weeks | Points → Governance |

We chose 5% (matching Ethena) with longer duration to allow time for Morpho integration and organic growth without Ethena's pre-launch hype.
