# Buck Points Program

Season 1 of the Buck Points Program rewards early adopters across holding, liquidity provision, lending, and referrals.

## Overview

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 8 weeks |
| Base rate | 1 Buck Point per $10 BUCK per day |
| Minimum | $100 BUCK equivalent |
| Conversion | Buck Points convert to governance token allocation at TGE |
| Infrastructure | Merkl |
| BUCK Rewards | $25K per 2-week batch ($100K total) |

Buck Points are earned by participating in the Buck ecosystem. At TGE (Token Generation Event), Buck Points convert to a share of the protocol's governance token allocation. The exact conversion ratio and allocation percentage will be announced 4-6 weeks before TGE.

## How to Earn Buck Points

### Activity Weights

| Activity | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Holding | 50% | Hold BUCK in your wallet |
| LP (Curve/Uniswap) | 30% | Provide BUCK liquidity |
| Morpho Lending | 10% | Lend on Morpho markets |
| Referrals | 10% | Refer new users |

### Multipliers

Multipliers boost your Buck Point earning rate. They **do not stack** — the highest applicable multiplier is used.

#### Hold Duration Multiplier

| Duration | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| 0-29 days | 1x |
| 30+ days | 3x |

#### Activity Multipliers

| Activity | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| Hold BUCK | 1x |
| Curve LP | 3x |
| Uniswap V3 LP | 3x |
| Morpho Lending | 3x |

> Multipliers don't stack. If you're an LP with 30+ days of holding, you get max(3x, 3x) = 3x, not 9x.

## Earning Examples

### Example 1: Hold $10,000 BUCK for 8 weeks

| Period | Rate | Daily Buck Points | Total |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| Days 1-29 | 1x | 1,000 | 29,000 |
| Days 30-56 | 3x | 3,000 | 81,000 |
| **Total** | | | **110,000** |

### Example 2: $10,000 in Curve LP for 8 weeks

| Period | Rate | Daily Buck Points | Total |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| Days 1-56 | 3x | 3,000 | 168,000 |
| **Total** | | | **168,000** |

> LP multiplier (3x) applies from day 1. After 30+ days, the hold duration multiplier matches at 3x — no additional benefit.

## Concurrent BUCK Rewards

In addition to Buck Points, Merkl distributes BUCK tokens directly during Season 1 in **2-week batches**:

| Pool | Per Batch | 8-Week Total |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Holders | $12,500 | $50,000 |
| Curve LP | $8,333 | $33,333 |
| Uniswap V3 LP | $4,167 | $16,667 |
| **Total** | **$25,000** | **$100,000** |

These BUCK rewards are earned alongside Buck Points — they're separate reward streams.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

- **Daily snapshots** — Balances are captured daily, not at a single point in time
- **Minimum threshold** — $100 BUCK equivalent required to earn Buck Points
- **Continuous holding** — Moving tokens resets your hold duration multiplier

## Season Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Season 1 Start | TBD |
| Season 1 End | TBD (8 weeks after start) |
| Season 2 | TBD |
| TGE | TBD |

## Strategic Ambiguity

The following details will be announced 4-6 weeks before TGE:
- Token name and ticker
- Total supply
- Buck Points-to-token conversion ratio
- Allocation percentages

This approach mirrors successful launches like Ethena's, maintaining engagement through the full program duration.
