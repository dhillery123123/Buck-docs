# Claiming Your Yield

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Check the Calendar

Yield distributions happen on the **15th of each month** (or next trading day if the 15th falls on a weekend/holiday). The eligibility window is **9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET**.

### Step 2: Visit buck.io

1. Go to [buck.io](https://buck.io)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Navigate to the **Rewards** section

### Step 3: Review Your Distribution

You'll see:

* Your eligible BUCK balance
* Your share of the monthly distribution
* The USDC amount available to claim

### Step 4: Claim

1. Click **"Claim"**
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. USDC is sent to your wallet

```
Your BUCK balance stays the same.
You receive yield as USDC.
```

**BUCK Balance Unchanged**

Claiming yield does not reduce your BUCK balance. You keep your full BUCK position and receive yield as a separate USDC payment.
