# Monthly Distribution

## How It Works

BUCK yield is distributed automatically each month. On the **15th of each month**, the protocol takes a snapshot during U.S. market hours. Holders who have BUCK in their wallet during the eligibility window receive their share of that month's yield — no action required.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Eligibility Window**

**When:** 15th of each month, 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time

**Who:** All BUCK holders with a qualifying balance

**What:** Hold BUCK during this window to receive your share of STRC dividend yield
{% endhint %}

## The Eligibility Window

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Date** | 15th of each month |
| **Opens** | 9:00 AM ET |
| **Closes** | 4:00 PM ET |
| **Duration** | 7 hours |
| **Why market hours?** | Aligns with STRC trading on NASDAQ |

### Why 9 AM - 4 PM ET?

STRC trades on NASDAQ during U.S. market hours. The eligibility window aligns with these hours so that STRC pricing is live and accurate during distribution. This ensures fair, real-time valuation of the protocol's collateral.

## Eligibility Requirements

To receive your monthly yield distribution:

1. **Hold BUCK** — You must hold BUCK in your wallet during the eligibility window
2. **Minimum balance** — $100 BUCK minimum

Just hold BUCK during the window. Yield is distributed automatically as USDC — no transaction needed on your end.

## How Your Share is Calculated

Your monthly yield is based on your BUCK balance relative to the total supply:

```
Your Monthly Yield = (Your BUCK Balance / Total BUCK Supply) x Monthly Distribution Pool
```

### Example

```
Total BUCK Supply:     1,000,000 BUCK
Your Balance:          10,000 BUCK (1% of supply)
Monthly Yield Pool:    $83,333 (~10% annual / 12 months on $10M TVL)

Your Share:            $83,333 x 1% = $833.33
```

## Distribution Schedule

Distributions occur on the 15th of every month. If the 15th falls on a weekend or market holiday, distribution moves to the next trading day.

| Month | Distribution Date | Window |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| February 2026 | Feb 17 (Mon)* | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
| March 2026 | Mar 16 (Mon)* | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
| April 2026 | Apr 15 (Wed) | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
| May 2026 | May 15 (Fri) | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ET |

*Adjusted for weekends

## What If I Don't Hold During the Window?

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Hold During the Eligibility Window**

If you don't hold BUCK during the eligibility window on the 15th, you won't receive that month's yield. The unclaimed portion rolls into the next month's distribution pool. Set a reminder for the 15th of each month.
