# Monthly Distribution

## How It Works

BUCK yield is distributed automatically each month. On the **15th of each month**, the protocol takes a snapshot during U.S. market hours to determine eligible holders. Yield is then distributed in BUCK on the **first business day of the month following STRC dividend payment** — no action required.

**Eligibility Window**

**When:** 15th of each month, 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time

## The Eligibility Window

| Parameter             | Details                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Date**              | 15th of each month                 |
| **Opens**             | 9:00 AM ET                         |
| **Closes**            | 4:00 PM ET                         |
| **Duration**          | 7 hours                            |
| **Why market hours?** | Aligns with STRC trading on NASDAQ |

### Why 9 AM - 4 PM ET?

STRC trades on NASDAQ during U.S. market hours. The eligibility window aligns with these hours so that STRC pricing is live and accurate during distribution. This ensures fair, real-time valuation of the protocol's collateral.

## Eligibility Requirements
