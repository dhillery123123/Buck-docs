# How Yield Works

## The Yield Engine: STRC

BUCK's yield comes from **STRC** — Strategy's 10% perpetual preferred stock traded on NASDAQ. STRC pays contractual quarterly dividends, and Buck Protocol passes this yield through to BUCK holders via monthly distributions.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Real Yield from Real Assets**

BUCK delivers ~10% APY from STRC's contractual dividends — not token emissions, funding rates, or trading strategies. This yield is backed by Strategy's $60B+ Bitcoin treasury and $2.25B in cash reserves.

## Why STRC Dividends?

| Yield Type | Source | Can Go Negative? | Dependency |
|------------|--------|------------------|------------|
| **STRC Dividends** | Corporate preferred equity | No | Strategy solvency |
| Funding Rates | Perpetual futures | Yes | Market sentiment |
| Staking Yield | Proof of stake | No | Network activity |
| Lending Yield | Borrower interest | No | Credit demand |
| T-Bill Yield | Government bonds | No | Fed rates |

STRC dividends are:

* **Contractually obligated** — Preferred equity has senior legal claim to dividends
* **Paid regardless of market** — Not dependent on crypto market conditions
* **Long-term sustainable** — 77+ years of coverage at current reserves
* **Cannot go negative** — You will never owe yield back
